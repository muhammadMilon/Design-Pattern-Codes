# 🎯 Design-Pattern-Codes

Welcome to the **Design-Pattern-Codes** repository!  
This repository contains clean, structured, and real-world examples of different **Software Design Patterns**, mostly written in **Java** following **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles.

We have tried to strictly follow software design principles like:

- ✅ **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**
- ✅ **SOLID Principles**
  - **S**: Single Responsibility Principle  
  - **O**: Open/Closed Principle  
  - **L**: Liskov Substitution Principle  
  - **I**: Interface Segregation Principle  
  - **D**: Dependency Inversion Principle

## 📚 What are Design Patterns?

Design Patterns are proven solutions to common software design problems.  
They improve **code structure**, promote **reusability**, and make applications **scalable and maintainable**.

---

## 🧠 Motivation

We created this repository to:

- 📘 Strengthen our understanding of core design principles  
- 🛠️ Practice writing clean and reusable code  
- 🔍 Help peers and juniors with organized examples  
- 💼 Prepare ourselves for software engineering interviews and projects
